# Environment Files - Security Recommendation
#
# Consider adding production environment files to .gitignore
# if they contain sensitive information.
#
# Uncomment the lines below to ignore specific environment files:

# Ignore all environment files except the template
# environment.*.ts
# !environment.ts
# !environment.interface.ts

# Or ignore only production environments
# environment.production.ts
# environment.minusone.ts

# Note: If you ignore these files, make sure to:
# 1. Document the required structure in README.md
# 2. Provide example/template files
# 3. Configure CI/CD to inject values during build
# 4. Share sensitive values through secure channels (not Git)
